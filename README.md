# Switch to ClassicPress

![](assets/banner-772x250.png)

This is a WordPress plugin that switches a WordPress installation to
[ClassicPress](https://www.classicpress.net).

ClassicPress is for businesses seeking a powerful and versatile solution for
their website needs. Built on the firm foundation of WordPress 4.9.x,
ClassicPress takes your website to the next level with the same features and
functionality that you enjoyed with WordPress, but with more attention to the
most common needs of a business website.

ClassicPress is compatible with all plugins and themes that work in WordPress
`4.9.x`, so migration is easy.

**PLEASE NOTE:** ClassicPress is stable software, but it is important to take a
backup before switching a live production site to ClassicPress. Please also
ensure any known conflicting plugins are **deactivated** (see list
[here](https://docs.classicpress.net/installing-classicpress/#plugin-conflicts)).

## What version of WordPress does the plugin work with?

You can always see the latest supported version by going to [Get ClassicPress](https://www.classicpress.net/get-classicpress/#switch-to-classicpress).

## Installation

To **install a fresh version of ClassicPress on a new site**, you do not need
this plugin.  See our
[installation instructions](https://docs.classicpress.net/installing-classicpress/)
instead.

To **install ClassicPress on a current WordPress site** (switch a current
WordPress site to ClassicPress):

1. Back up the current site files and database. You can do a manual backup in
   your hosting panel and export the database, or you can use a backup plugin.
2. Download this plugin from the
   [Releases page](https://github.com/ClassicPress/ClassicPress-Migration-Plugin/releases)
   here on GitHub.
3. Install the downloaded zip file from within the WordPress dashboard
   ("Plugins" -> "Add New" -> "Upload Plugin").
4. Activate this plugin ("Switch to ClassicPress") after it is installed.
5. Go to the ClassicPress Migration plugin by clicking the **Switch** link in
   this plugin's table row, or at **Tools -> Switch to ClassicPress**.
6. If all the checks pass, press the **Switch this site to ClassicPress now!**
   button. If not, you'll probably need to upgrade WordPress or PHP.
7. The migration process may take a few minutes depending on your hosting
   provider, so go grab some water or a beverage of your choice üôÇ
8. When the process is finished, you should see the ClassicPress About screen.
   At this point it is safe to delete the ‚ÄúSwitch to ClassicPress‚Äù plugin.
9. You may be prompted to upgrade ClassicPress immediately after switching from
   WordPress.  This is normal, and it is safe to upgrade.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will my current plugins and themes work in ClassicPress?

If your current plugins work in WordPress 4.9.x, they will work in ClassicPress
too.  If you‚Äôre seeing something otherwise, that may be a bug with
ClassicPress, and we‚Äôd appreciate you reporting it on
[our support forum](https://forums.classicpress.net/c/support/)
or
[GitHub](https://github.com/ClassicPress).

### How can I use this plugin with an unsupported version of WordPress?

This plugin currently supports migrating from WordPress versions starting at
`4.9.0`.

We update the plugin as quickly as possible when a new version of WordPress
comes out, but we do need to test each new version for compatibility with the
plugin first.

If you would like to migrate from a different version of WordPress **at your
own risk**, you can use the following code in your current theme's
`functions.php` file or a mu-plugin to enable the migration:

`add_filter( 'classicpress_ignore_wp_version', '__return_true' );`

With each new WordPress release, it's very helpful for us to have multiple
reports of whether the migration plugin works with the new version.  You can
use the filter above to test the migration process, and you can tell us about
the results of your testing
[on GitHub](https://github.com/ClassicPress/ClassicPress-Migration-Plugin/issues)
or
[on the support subforum for the migration plugin](https://forums.classicpress.net/c/support/migration-plugin).

### I need help with something else, what should I do?

Like all of ClassicPress, our support is a volunteer effort by the community.
If you need help with something, please let us know in
[our support forum](https://forums.classicpress.net/c/support/)
or
[Slack group](https://www.classicpress.net/join-slack/).
