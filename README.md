# Upgrade to ClassicPress

![](assets/banner-772x250.png)

This is a WordPress plugin that upgrades a WordPress installation to
[ClassicPress](https://www.classicpress.net).

ClassicPress is for businesses seeking a powerful and versatile solution for
their website needs. Built on the firm foundation of WordPress 4.9.x,
ClassicPress takes your website to the next level with the same features and
functionality that you enjoyed with WordPress, but with more attention to the
most common needs of a business website.

ClassicPress is compatible with all plugins that work in WordPress 4.9.x, so
upgrading is easy.

The ClassicPress `1.0.0-alpha1` release (codename "Sunrise") is ready to be
tested by you, the users!

**PLEASE NOTE:** As ClassicPress is currently in Alpha testing stage, we do not
recommend that you upgrade a live production site to ClassicPress.

## Installation

To **install a fresh version of ClassicPress on a new site**, you do not need
this plugin.  See our
[installation instructions](https://docs.classicpress.net/installing-classicpress/)
instead.

To **install ClassicPress on a current WordPress site** (upgrade a current
WordPress site to ClassicPress):

1. Back up the current site files and database. You can do a manual backup in
   your hosting panel and export the database, or you can use a backup plugin.
2. Download this plugin from the
   [Releases page](https://github.com/ClassicPress/ClassicPress-Migration-Plugin/releases)
   here on GitHub.
3. Install the downloaded zip file from within the WordPress dashboard
   ("Plugins" -> "Add New" -> "Upload Plugin").
4. Activate this plugin ("Upgrade to ClassicPress") after it is installed.
5. Go to the ClassicPress Upgrade plugin by clicking the **Upgrade** link in
   this plugin's table row, or at **Tools -> Upgrade to ClassicPress**.
6. If all the checks pass, press the **Upgrade this site to ClassicPress now!**
   button. If not, you'll probably need to upgrade WordPress or PHP.
7. The upgrade process may take a few minutes depending on your hosting
   provider, so go grab some water or a beverage of your choice ðŸ™‚
8. When the process is finished, you should see the ClassicPress About screen.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will my current plugins and themes work in ClassicPress?

If your current plugins work in WordPress 4.9.x, they will work in ClassicPress
too.  If youâ€™re seeing something otherwise, thatâ€™s probably a bug with
ClassicPress, and weâ€™d appreciate you reporting it on
[our support forum](https://forums.classicpress.net/c/support/)
or
[GitHub](https://github.com/ClassicPress).

### Iâ€™m a developer, will I need to learn any new language or framework to develop in ClassicPress?

Not unless you want to!  We have some exciting features planned for version 2
and beyond, but they will all be optional and fully backwards-compatible.
